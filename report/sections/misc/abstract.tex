  Functional Reactive Programming presents a way to create animations and program user interactions
  and I/O in a declarative and functional manner. However, implementing FRP efficiently
  while adhering to the original denotational semantics has proved to be a complicated task. Additionally, most
  research an implementation of the subject has been performed using the pure functional language
  Haskell. This report will present a way to implement FRP efficiently using the non-standard setting of the
  multi-paradigm language Scala.
