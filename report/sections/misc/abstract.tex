\abstract{
  Functional Reactive Programming, a programming paradigm proposed by Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak, presents a way to create 
  animations, program user interactions
  and deal with I/O in a declarative and functional manner. However, implementing FRP in a way that
  uses a bounded level of memory and that adheres to the original denotational semantics has proved to be a complicated task. Additionally, most
  research and implementation of the subject has been performed using the pure functional language
  Haskell. This report will present a way to implement FRP in a manner that allows for bounded memory usage within the 
  non-standard setting of the multi-paradigm language Scala.
