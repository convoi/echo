\chapter{Previous Implementations}

  \section{Scala}
    As one might imagine, there has been previous work in implementing FRP in Scala. 

    \subsection{Reactive}
      Arguably the most significant of the FRP work in Scala is the library `reactive' created by `nafg \cite{Nafg}'. This    
      framework was designed to allow for the creation of functional reactive web applications however here we are concerned 
      with the basic FRP library `reactive-core'. Unfortunately while claiming to be an FRP library `Reactive'
      has a couple of problems.

      The framework is based around two types designed to represent Behaviours and Events respectively: Signals
      and EventStreams. EventStreams are very close to the original Event but Signal deviates quite significantly form 
      Behaviours. Signal is defined as follows:

      \begin{quote}
        In practical terms, a Signal has a current value, and an EventStream that, whenever the Signal's value changes,     
        fires the new value.
      \end{quote}  

      Although it is claimed that this results in Signals having a continuous value we can see
      that at any point in time it is really just a static value that changes at discrete point in
      time. We can see that this doesn't allow us to represent purely continuous values. For instance
      we could not represent the following basic Behaviour with a Signal:

\begin{verbatim}
new Behaviour(time => time)
\end{verbatim}

      It can be seen that a Signal[T] can however be represented in terms
      of the `switcher' function meaning that it does have some relevance to Behaviours:

\begin{verbatim}
def signal[T](v : T, ev : Event[T]) = {
switcher(lift0(v), map(ev, (t, o) => lift0(o)))
}
\end{verbatim}  

      This functionality was additionally encapsulated within the `stepper' function in Conal Elliott's
      `Push-Pull' paper \cite{Elliott2009}:

\begin{verbatim}
stepper[T](v : T, ev : Event[T]) : Behaviour[T]
stepper(v, ev) = switcher(lift(v), map(ev, (t, o) => lift(o)))
\end{verbatim} 

      It can be seen here that although Signal provides a useful programming tool it is not an implementation
      of an FRP Behaviour and only allows for a subset of a Behaviour's functionality meaning that `Reactive'
      does not successfully implement FRPs semantics.

    \subsection{React}
      While not claiming to be an implementation of FRP the `React' framework proposed in the 
      paper `Deprecating the Observer Pattern' \cite{Maier2010} does utilise a notion of Events that, as cited in the paper,
      has its routes in FRP.

      The Event's in React are very similar to the Events in Fran \cite{Elliott1997}: they are conceptually infinite
      and have the \emph{merge} and \emph{map} operations defined on them. One slight difference is that React's
      Events expose an operation to allow them to `occur' with a public \emph{emit} function. This disrupts
      the abstraction of Events somewhat. For instance, if we have again have a \emph{mouseB} Event we could do the following:

\begin{verbatim}
val event = mouseB
event.emit(())
\end{verbatim}      

      Here we cause the mouse button Event to occur without the actual input occurring. It will be shown later how to     
      internalise this action effectively so as to maintain the abstraction. 

      Interestingly, React also contains a notion of Signals, just as Reactive does, 
      however it doesn't claim that these are an implementation of Behaviours (although the word `continuous' is
      used loosely in their description). 

  It can be seen from these examples that while many of the concepts from FRP are popular
  in the Scala community there has been little attempt to implement FRP within Scala while honouring
  the original denotational semantics.
