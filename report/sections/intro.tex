\chapter{Introduction}

Dealing with animations, user interactions and I/O are often thought of as monotonous imperative tasks
in programming. This is somewhat counter intuitive and often forces programmers to use imperative
styles within more declarative code. Many of these tasks are possible to generalise in fact: adding
some action to a button click, looping through some animation. Functional Reactive Programming
is a programming paradigm that aims to provide programmers with the tools to create high level,
declarative abstractions of these kinds of tasks. This report is concerned with a project to
implement Functional Reactive Programming as a framework dubbed `echo' for the multi-paradigm programming language
Scala.
