\chapter{Limitations}
  
  \section{Need for Abstraction}
    % Operations need abstracted over (outputs)
    % Need to build Event abstraction for input
    % Promotes clean code once this is done
    
  \section{Learning Curve}
    % Initially hard to understand
    % Some subtle semantics (hard to just teach basics)
    % Distracting subjects on the way to it
    % Hopefully this can help?
  
  \section{Where to Stop}
    % Should all code be FRP
    % Can it abstract over anything?
