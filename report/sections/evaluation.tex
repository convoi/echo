\chapter{Evaluation}
  
  \section{Original Semantics}
    % With massive restrictions it works
    % Removes functionality
  
  \section{Impurity}
    % Behaviour functions can read external sources
    % As reading is done in real time its kind of ok
    % Behaviour functions can cause side effects - not good
    % Must assume programmers know what they are doing
    % Good documentation is needed
  
  \section{Demo Applications}
    % Demo applications provide test of development process
    % Music application easy to develop logic (very intuitive)
    % Needed abstraction for Song but produces resuable component
    % Password application easy to develop
  
  \section{Limitations}
    % No predicate function
    % Removes ability to evaluate Behaviours at any time
