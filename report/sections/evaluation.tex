  \section{Original Semantics}
    It is important that the FRP implemented in `echo' is a correct model of the denotational semantics
    set out in the original Fran paper \cite{Elliott1997} as this was one of the primary motivations for
    the project. Earlier, it was mentioned that formal program testing was used to verify
    this somewhat (the test cases can be viewed the `echo' source). Earlier sections of this report
    that discuss modifications to the rules and restrictions additionally verify that these choices meet the original 
    specification. However, although restrictions such as real-time evaluation on Behaviours do not
    alter their original semantic definition they do remove some of FRP's functionality.
    
  \section{Limitations}
    % No predicate function
    % Removes ability to evaluate Behaviours at any time
  
  \section{Impurity}
    % Behaviour functions can read external sources
    % As reading is done in real time its kind of ok
    % Behaviour functions can cause side effects - not good
    % Must assume programmers know what they are doing
    % Good documentation is needed
  
  \section{Demo Applications}
    % Demo applications provide test of development process
    % Music application easy to develop logic (very intuitive)
    % Needed abstraction for Song but produces resuable component
    % Password application easy to develop
