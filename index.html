          <h3>1. Get It</h3>
          <p>
            You can download the latest jar of the framework 
            <a href="https://github.com/downloads/oetzi/echo/echo.jar">here</a>. Just
            stick it in your project folder. I'd personally recommend <a href="http://buildr.apache.org/">buildr</a> 
            for building and compiling Scala projects.

          <h3>2. FRP</h3>
          <p>
            Functional Reactive Programming is concerned with programming with two new types: Behaviours
            and Events. Behaviours are continuous values that change over time and Events are infinite
            streams of values that 'occur' at a discrete point in time - we can think of them as
            as a stream of time and value pairs. Mental eh?
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Lets see some examples. Here we're going to make a simple Behaviour:
          </p>
          <pre>
  val beh = Behaviour(time => time * 2)</pre>
        
          <p>
            This Behaviour will, at a given time <code>t</code> have the value <code>t * 2</code>. So how do we actually
            get at that value? We use the <code>eval</code> function:
          </p>
          
          <pre>
  val value = beh.eval()
  println(value)</pre>
  
          <p>
            The above code would evaluate the Behaviour at the current time and then print the calculated
            value out.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So what about Events? Well here's something. Imagine we have an Event <code>mouseEv</code>
            that occurs every time the left mouse button is pressed. We could construct a Behaviour like this:
          </p>
          
          <pre>
  val false = new Behaviour(time => false)
  val true = new Behaviour(time => true)
  val beh = false.until(mouseEv, true)</pre>
  
          <p>
            This creates a Behaviour that has the value <code>false</code> until the left mouse button is
            pressed, at which point its value is <code>true</code>. Cool? How about this:
          </p>
          
          <pre>
  val beh = false.toggle(mouseEv, true)</pre>  
  
         <p>
           Guess what this does? Thats right. It produced a Behaviour that toggles between <code>false</code>
           and <code>true</code> whenever that crazy left mouse button is pressed.
         </p> 
         
         <p>
           Getting the hang of this? Lets jump in at the deep end:
          </p>
         
          <pre>
   val mouseTimes = mouseEv.map((t, v) => t)
   val lastTime = new Stepper(-1, mouseTimes)</pre>
   
          <p>
            Ok. Here we map the mouse button Event to return a new Event who's values are that of the times
            of each occurrence. We then use a Stepper. A Stepper is a Behaviour that has an initial value
            and an Event: at any point in time its value will be the Event's last occurrence's value (or the initial
            value if the Event hasn't occurred). With all that put together you will see that we've created a Behaviour
            that's value will always be the last time the mouse button was pressed (or <code>-1</code> to specify it 
            was never pressed).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That should all have hopefully got you into the right frame of mind. Lets move on to writing
            some code in echo...
